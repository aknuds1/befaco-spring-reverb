# SPRING REVERB V2.5 ASSEMBLY REFERENCE
**Thanks for choosing our kits!**
This manual is written taking with the problems that we usually find in our workshops in mind.
Also the order is meant to make assembly as easy as possible.
Some steps are not obvious so even if you're an experienced DIYer, read the steps completely before
taking them.
If this is your first project, please read this article before you start assembling the kit: [www.befaco.org/howto/](http://www.befaco.org/howto/)

**May the luck be with you!**

### DIODES
Solder the diodes respecting the polarity. Black or white line on the diode must be in the same place as white line on diode symbol on PCB silkscreen.

|Qty |Value |Name on PCB|
|----|------|-----------|
|6 |1N4148 |D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D7|
|1 |1N5231 |D6|
|2 |1N5817 |(black color) D8, D9|

### FERRITE
Solder the two ferrite beads passing trough a recycled resistor leg and proceed as if it were a resistor. Ferrite beads don't have polarity.
The space for ferrites is a bit tight. Leave them a bit separated from the board to make them fit between power connector and diodes.

|Qty |Name on PCB|
|----|-----------|
|2 |FERRITE+, FERRITE|

### ICs
Place the sockets taking care of the orientation and solder them on IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4 and IC5. The orientation must match the PCB's drawing.
Place the five ICs on the sockets taking care of polarity. To do that the mark on front must match the mark on the socket and the PCB's silkscreen.

|Qty |Value |Name on PCB|
|----|------|-----------|
|2 |TL074/84 |IC1, IC5|
|2 |LM13700 |IC3, IC4|
|1 |TL072/82 |IC5|

### CAPACITORS
|Qty |Value |Code |Name on PCB|
|----|------|-----|-----------|
|3 |47p |47 |C5, C12, C17|
|4 |100p |101 |C4, C10, C16, C18|
|1 |330p |331 |C3|
|1 |1n |1n (Polyester) |C9|
|1 |15n| 15n (Polyester) |C8|
|11 |100n |104 |C2, C6, C7, C11, C13, C14, C15, C19, C20, C22, C24|

### ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS
Values written at the side of the capacitor. Mind polarity. Check positive terminal on board and make it match with long leg.

|Qty |Value |Code |Name on PCB|
|----|------|-----|-----------|
|3 |10µF |10µF |C1, C21, C23|

### TRANSISTORS
Be sure they are on proper position (same as the silkscreen on the PCB)

|Qty |Value |Name on PCB|
|----|------|-----------|
|1 |2N3904 |T1|
|6 |2N3906 |T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7|
|1 |BC517 |Q1|
|1 |BC516 |Q2|

### TRIMMERS
Solder the four 100k trimmers on Offset 1, 2, 3, 4 with the screw facing out of the PCB

### MALE PIN HEADERS
Place and solder the tree Male Pin Headers at silkscreen side, ensuring it is 90º from PCB. Shortest side of the pins is for soldering.

### POWER CONNECTOR
Solder the power connector ensuring the position is correct: it must must be on the silkscreen side with the pins facing out.

### RCA CONNECTORS
Place and solder the RCA connectors (same as the silkscreen on the PCB).

**RCA-OUT pcb (White conector) –--> IN-Tank-Reverb (White conector)
 RCA-IN pcb (Red conector) –--> OUT-Tank-Reverb (Red conector)**
